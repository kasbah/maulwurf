# Maulwurf

A mole made using Marc Dusseiller's [DIY CAD method](https://www.hackteria.org/wiki/Diy-CAD). The circuit is a little oscillator using a CD4093 quad nand-gate and a piezo buzzer. Touch the mole's hands or underside, or stick it into the ground to change the sound.

To see a preview of the board and buy the parts go to the [Kitspace page](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/kasbah/maulwurf/). Send the Gerbers to any PCB batching service to make your own.The top copper should also be _home_ etchable and work by itself without any of the other layers.
